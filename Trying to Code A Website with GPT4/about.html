                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of technology that creates programs to simulate human intelligence such as complex problem-solving, reasoning, thinking, decision-making, and learning. While AI is a broad and swiftly evolving field, it can be examined through the lens of capabilities and functions. 
                </p>
            <p>
                AI capability types are generally categorized as Narrow AI, General AI, and Super AI. Narrow AI is designed to perform one task and cannot deviate beyond that specialty. This is the most common type and is already integrated into our lives, even if we do not recognize it all the time. Examples of Narrow AI include Google Translate, personal assistants such as Siri or Alexa, spam filtering, and predictive text. General AI will be able to complete and learn any cognitive tasks that humans can, so far, this type has not been developed successfully. Super AI is predicted to surpass human intelligence and our ability to complete tasks. At this level, it is theorized that AI can not only understand, but have its own emotions, desires, needs, and beliefs. 
                </p>
            <p>
                AI functions can be separated into reactive machines, limited memory, theory of mind, and self-awareness. Reactive machines utilize only present data and react to the world they perceive rather than using previous experience or data sets. This type of AI does not learn from past experiences or deviate from its set task. An example of this AI would be Deep Blue from IBM, a reactive machine that played chess, it could not learn or improve. Deep Blue only recognized the pieces, knew how they should move, and could make predictions about what the next moves could be. Limited Memory trains and learns from past data to make decisions. The data it draws from does not last forever, which is why it is considered limited memory. An example would be self-driving cars, information about the vehicles and surrounding environment is collected and applied to make decisions but not kept forever because they are no longer relevant. Theory of Mind and Self-Aware remain mostly conceptual. Theory of Mind would require the ability to understand and convey human emotion, thoughts, and concepts. Hanson Robotics created Sophia, a robot that has made some progress in this aspect, she can make eye contact, recognize people, and track their movements. Self-Awareness is even more theoretical, such technology would be more intelligent than humans, and not only understand complex human emotions and thoughts but have their own.

            <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
            <div class="black-bar"></div>
            <p>
                Machine Learning (ML) falls under the umbrella of AI, notably, it allows machines to learn from data presented and to improve performance without requiring additional programming. Algorithms for ML can analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions. Types of ML include supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning remains one of the most common types. Historical data with an input and output is presented and processed. The algorithm will develop models that try to match the result. For example, in predicting performance, previous applicant scores on assessments could be paired with their performance appraisals on the job. Unsupervised learning takes data and searches for more subtle patterns and creates clusters rather than being presented with a set input and output. An example of how this can be applied is when presented with customer data, unsupervised learning may create a cluster of customers based on purchasing history and identify that they may be interested in another product based on the purchasing history of people who bought similar items. Reinforcement learning includes the addition of a positive or negative reward based on the behavior of the algorithm. For example, an algorithm designed to identify risk for loans that identified someone as high risk would receive positive feedback if the person defaulted and negative feedback if they did not.
