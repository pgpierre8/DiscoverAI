                <p>The evolving nature of AI/ML means there will be upcoming related trends that HR/OD Practitioners will want to follow closely. A search through sources on this matter confirms how relevant this will be in 2023. AI-Augmented software development was named a top technology trend in 2023 by Encora, a global company focused on providing companies with accelerated technology innovation with their software engineering services and solutions. This software development is the core of process automation, it uses machine learning to build AI solutions. Society of Human Resource Management (SHRM) recently posted an article Top HR Tech Trends that identified the acceleration of AI application usage in not only in talent acquisition, but as a strategic asset in HR for analyzing engagement/worker data as a top trend. 
                    </p>
                <p> In 2022 we saw AI applications trend in real-world applications such as ChatGPT and AI art generator. Outside the workplace employees may already have exposure to these types of applications and may even utilize them, such as ChatGPT to their advantage within their own work. This can be viewed as an opportunity for HR Practitioners to focus on which employees across specific departments are adapting to this technology, as they are showing advancement in their skillset and ability to work beyond traditional methods. These employees will be important to retain as companies continue to deploy more human to machine collaboration and AI in general. Those deployments will mean companies need engaged and skilled individuals who are adaptable and knowledgeable of technical integrations. However, a risk that HR Practitioners need to be aware of with these real-world applications is the potential of not meeting government and state regulations that may be in place or coming into effect regarding AI applications. While companies and practitioners closely monitor upcoming guidance, the need for standardized internal policies regarding AI usage and AI tools already integrated into a company’s workflow should be established and rolled out. If not done companies may find themselves assuming more risk than anticipated. 
                    </p>
                <p> Ganes Kesari, Data science advisor and Forbers Contributor gathered that a top AI trend for 2023 is defining the business purpose of AI by leaders. This trend may be difficult for some company leaders to adopt as it requires them to first develop a sound strategic plan for AI initiatives instead of investing money at simple AI solutions. Looking closer, HR Practitioners can seize this trend as an opportunity to be seen as a valuable coordinator by leaders. This is where being up-to-date and knowledgeable enough to understand the business case for AI initiatives and the technical aspect of them comes into play. If you as a practitioner decide to not acquaint yourself with this new era and/or resist adaptation, then you will lack the ability to engage with key functional leaders who may call upon HR for their insight when making informed decisions on the company’s direction with AI initiatives. Also, this is an opportunity for HR/OD Practitioners to develop their skills in building strong business cases and auditing HR functions that are already integrated with AI tools. If leaders of a company are not being strategic with AI initiatives, practitioners should do their own diligences and ensure their current HR functions integrated with AI are sound and in align with the needs of the HR team, company, and employees. Overall, these gathered risks and opportunities are items you will want in the forefront of your mind as we begin the year of 2023 and take on the new ways of work with AI/ML.
