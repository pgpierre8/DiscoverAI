                <p> Process Automation when used to its potential can be a benefit to both the employee and the employer, which is something that most businesspersons understand at this age and time. It not only increases the overall efficiency of the way one works but also increases their time and energy needed to continue working on higher-valued tasks. As a result of that shift business may see an increase in revenue, error minimization, and increased customer satisfaction. However, as processes become more automated, and employees begin to rely more heavily on these tools to complete the task at hand the deep knowledge of how the process is done without said tools may lessen over time. This is an important variable for HR/OD Practitioners to know as it may shift the qualifications one may need for specific roles, create new roles and/or lead to work displacement. If work tasks are being completed by the AI/ML, then roles that solely focused on those will now be dissolved and businesses will need to be strategic on how they want to utilize those workers. They will need to invest in employees who understand how their systems work and how to manage them for the business. This isn’t new news if you have already read our Let's Talk AI blogs, so instead we are going to pivot and take a closer look at some process automation in the field of HR/OD to ensure we are evolving in this era as needed. 
                    </p>
                <p> AI/ML is not new to the area of talent acquisition, for some years now automating those tedious tasks and replacing traditional methods of recruiting have been in place. For example, AI recruitment software can help identify qualified candidates in a large pool of applicants based on whether they meet the criteria of the job based on data from the job posting in the system. If recruiters leverage this resume screening tool it allows them to shift more of their focus on engaging with potential candidates who meet the needs of the role and the company overall. Also, it helps prevent unconscious biases in the hiring process as AI is focused solely on ranking and assessing candidates’ information on data relevant to the qualifications from resume, thus ensuring recruiters are inherently more objective once interacting with candidates. Overall, this helps companies enhance their diversity. The significance here for HR Practitioners is that process automation is not only a game changer for speed and efficiency in recruitment but has a large-scale impact on the company. 
                    </p>
                <p> However, at the rate AI is evolving there is a good chance HR Practitioners are only tapping into a small portion of what HRIS or AI recruitment software systems are capable of. Practitioners should periodically audit their current workflows that utilize process automation to determine if there are any gaps and the benefits of implementing any offered new features. For example, if your HRIS Systems can integrate reference checks into the automated background check process this can eliminate the need for separate manual reference checks that take significant time for recruiters and can streamline the process for both recruiter and candidates. 
                    </p>
                <p> Another significant implication for HR/OD Practitioners regarding process automation is being vigilant of AI-Led issues. AI is not meant to fully replace the human, instead we need to learn how to collaborate with the machines that are a part of our workforce now and identity when they are being disruptive. It will be our job to assess these tools periodically and be able to identity an issue and how to correct. Let’s take resume screening, if your AI-System is based on data representative of 1 to 2 certain demographics this is no longer beneficial as it will hinder your chances to be more diverse from the very start of your hiring process. 
                    </p>
                <p> In general, HR/OD Practitioners will need to understand how AI is currently implemented in key functions of our world such as recruitment and onboarding to be valuable to their teams, leadership, and the employees. We need to be flexible to the changes that will surround our AI adapted workflows to leverage available technology to the fullest and combat issues that can arise with Al/ML collaboration.
